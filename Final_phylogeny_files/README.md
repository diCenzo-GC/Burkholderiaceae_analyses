# Final phylogeny files

For each phylogeny presented in the study, there are three files provided in this directory:
1 - The "image" file. This file contains the original, high-quality figure of the phylogeny
2 - The "newick" file. This file contains the Newick formatted tree, including bootstrap values and branch lengths.
3 - The "annotation" file. This file contains the annotations used for colouring the tree.
