# Burkholderiaceae analyses

diCenzo GC, Mengoni A, Perrin E. 2018. Emergence and features of the multipartite genome structure of the family *Burkholderiaceae* revealed through comparative and evolutionary genomics. bioRxiv. doi:10.1101/382267.

The directory "Final_phylogeny_files" contains the data underlying the phylogenies of the above study, including the Newick formatted tree, the annotation file, and a high resolution image.

A set of scripts used to perform the analyses reported in the above preprint. If you use adaptations of any of these scripts or pipelines as part of your work, please ensure you cite our preprint.

Included in this repository is a set of scripts and the accessions to download the genomes used in this work.

In many cases, manual steps were performed as part of the overall pipeline of the different analyses. Additionally, the scripts contain references to directories found on our machine. As such, it is expected that attempting to simply run these scripts without adaptation will fail to replicate our results.
